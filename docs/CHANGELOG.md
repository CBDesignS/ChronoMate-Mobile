# ChronoMate Android Changelog

## v0.6.9

### Fixed

- The recorded-shot counter now resets immediately when the current shot string is cleared.
- The counter displays `0 of the selected target` without waiting for another shot to be entered.
- No changes were made to shot entry, calculations, reports, import/export or Android keyboard handling.
- Updated Android application version to v0.6.9 with versionCode 23.
- Updated GitHub Actions to generate `ChronoMate-v0.6.9.apk`.

---

## v0.6.8

### Fixed

- Corrected the top header layout on newer wide-screen Fire HD 10 tablets in landscape orientation.
- Added a tablet-width header breakpoint so the title area and settings use the full available width instead of leaving an unused area on the right.
- Kept the existing phone, older Fire tablet, desktop, import, keyboard and report behaviour unchanged.
- Updated Android application version to v0.6.8 with versionCode 22.

---

## v0.6.7

- Improved Fire OS shot-entry workflow.
- After the keyboard Enter key records a shot, ChronoMate now asks Android to reopen the on-screen keyboard while keeping focus on the cleared FPS field.
- Android 17 behaviour is unchanged when its keyboard already remains visible.

## v0.6.6

### Fixed
- Added a narrowly scoped Android file-reading fallback for Fire OS 7 document providers.
- ChronoMate still uses the existing `openInputStream()` import path first.
- If that path fails, Android retries the same selected URI through an `AssetFileDescriptor`.
- No changes were made to the backup format, JavaScript importer, desktop files, export process or working Android 17 / Fire OS 5 import path.

## v0.6.5

### Fixed

- Improved backup-file selection compatibility on older Fire OS tablets by allowing any openable document instead of relying on the inconsistently recognised `application/json` MIME type.
- Added an `ACTION_GET_CONTENT` fallback for Android builds that do not provide a working `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` picker.
- Backup files are now read and validated natively by Android before being passed directly into ChronoMate's existing JavaScript import function.
- Removed the additional WebView `JSON.parse()` hand-off step that could fail on older Fire OS WebView versions.
- Added handling for an optional UTF-8 byte-order mark at the start of a backup file.

### Changed
